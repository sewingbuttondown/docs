# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to add things like links, images, lists, and styles to plain text.

It was created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net) back in 2004 and has quickly become nigh-ubiquitous thanks to its simple goal:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

There's a good chance that, even if you haven't heard of Markdown, you've used it before! It powers applications like Reddit and GitHub.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, but it's very quick to learn.

Markdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word or other WYSIWYG editors, but it shines at creating simple, elegant documents — which is what Buttondown is all about.

## Buttondown's Markdown rendering engine

Buttondown's Markdown rendering engine is [Python-Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown). Some details about the gnarly implementation below:
feel free to ignore this unless you're a Buttondown (and/or Markdown) power user!

### Extensions

In addition, Buttondown uses a handful of extensions:

- [smarty](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/smarty/), to convert ASCII characters into HTML entities
- [tables](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/tables/), to allow basic tables
- [footnotes](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/footnotes/), to allow basic footnotes. (These are rendered in your online archives using [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com))
- [fenced_code](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/), to allow a more common approach for embedding code snippets
- [pymdownx.tilde](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/tilde/), for allowing of deletions and subscripts
- [CodeHilite](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/), for syntax highlighting of code snippets

### Embeds

In addition to all of _those_, Buttondown uses some proprietary extensions for embedding things like tweets, YouTube videos, and gifs — but none of these should affect your general rendering experience.

If you're looking for an escape hatch out of these embeds, they only trigger on links that are on self-contained lines, like the following:

```markdown
Here is a tweet I liked!

https://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/1352057677359288321
```

So you can avoid it by simply doing something like:

```markdown
Here is a tweet I liked!

<div>https://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/1352057677359288321</div>
```

### Tables of contents

If you're interested in creating a table of contents in your Buttondown newsletter, be sure to
use _names_ (such as `<a name='heading'>`) rather than _ids_ (such as `<a id='heading'>`)! Gmail
and many other email clients strip `id` tags from emails, which will break internal links.
